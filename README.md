# I just need a bit of data from a mongoDB!

If you've ever said that phrase, youre not alone. I had just the same issue, and in general this is the simplest way to create a node.js api and react front end to display a single item. at least that ive been able to come up with. There are tons of guides on making an express server, using mongoose, connecting to an API endpoint with axios or fetch. I Struggled to find one that included all of these aspects. 

/api run

    npm i

/react-front-end run

    yarn
